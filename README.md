Cocktail is designed to facilitate resource constrained collaborative inquiry on optical satellite assets. Resource constrained collaboration is supported in several different ways. Cocktail will vary parameters of a classifier in batch mode and store the classifier performances for each setting so you can collaboratively can find the best configuration. Cocktail keeps track of the large collection of parameters across the individual processing modules in a single file such that remote collaborators can reliably replicate a workflow. Moreover, Cocktail can be linked with an external cloud storage provider to move assets out of the compute environment for low-cost storage of large GIS files. 

Cocktail is designed as a compendium to other GIS investigation environments, combines GDAL. OTB and GQIS elements, and is intened to be deployed remotely. The combination requires some attention. The [Orfeo](https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/tag/machine-learning/) machine learning library and the translator library for raster and vector geospatial data formats [GDAL](https://gdal.org/) do not play well with the open source geographic information system [QGIS](https://qgis.org) outside of a resource intensive GUI environment.  Cocktail allows you to setup a low-cost virtual computer to apply several different classifiers including vector support machines, random forests, neural networks and various bandmath operations across GDAL, OTB and QGIS.

Private sector, high-resolution, daily-updated satellite assets have become a significant resource for remote sensing operations. A case in point is PlanetScope (PS), currently operating the largest collection of small Earth-imaging satellites. Cocktail facilitates the combination of free and commercial satellite assets to monitor  an area of interest with a low cost system, and then switches to a high resolution asset only if a condition of concern or interest has been detected and not adequately understood in the first data set. Not unlike the tip and cue concept in which one monitors an area of interest with one sensor and then ‘tips’ another complementary sensor platform to acquire another image over the same area, Cocktail tips and cues based on economic constraints.<br><br>

Check the [Install+Use document](https://github.com/realtechsupport/cocktail/blob/main/Install+Use.pdf) for details and examples.
<br><br>
Here is a brief description of the steps required to get started:

1 - VM <br>
Create a virtual computer. Choose Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, with at least 16GB of RAM. If you intend on working with Sentinel data from ESA, it can be beneficial to build a VM close to ESA in Frankfurt. <br>

2- Get the repo files from this Github site. <br>

	git clone https://github.com/realtechsupport/cocktail.git
	
You will have all the files in the correct directory structure on your computer after the download. <br>

3 - Install QGIS. <br>
Go to the setup folder. Make the file basics+qgis.sh executable.<br>

  	chmod +x basics+qgis.sh
	
Run that file. <br>

  	sh basics+qgis.sh

4 - Install OTB in a virtual environment with conda. <br>
Go to the setup folder. Make the file conda-packages.sh executable. <br>

  	chmod +x conda-packages.sh
	
Run that file. <br>

  	sh conda-packages.sh
	
5 - Create a conda environment with defined dependencies.<br>
(OTB 7.2 requires python 3.7, for example.)

	conda env create -f environment.yml
	

6 - Customize <br>
Add other libraries to the OTB environment as needed. Enable the OTB environment 

	conda activate OTB
	
7 – Setup the directory structure <br>
The directories code, data, results should be ready made in your repository directory.
Adjust the paths to reflect your current installation. From the setup folder run the adjust_datapaths script:

	python3 adjust_datapaths.py 
	
Follow the prompt. All paths will be adjusted to your current installation and the settings.txt file will be updated accordingly. 
Put analysis-ready raster and vector files (including shapefiles) into the data/collection directory. Use the settings.txt file (in the data directory) to set your file names, process preferences and classification parameters. The content of this file is parsed and passed to the classification steps.

Change the fake username and passwords in the auth folder according to your needs. PC.txt is for pCloud, sent.txt for sentinel and planet.txt for Planet Labs. Put data from sentinel and planet into the collection directory. Add .geojson references files (for sentinel and planet downloads) and colormaps as needed to the data directory. 

 
8 - Test<br>
a) Test QGIS - (test scripts are in the code directory)

Change to the code directory and deactivate the conda environment

	conda deactivate
	
Run the qgis test in the base environment <br>

  	python3 qgis_test.py
	

b) Test OTB

Activate the OTB environment <br>

  	conda activate OTB
	
Run the otb test <br>

  	python3 otb_test.py
	
c) Update settings
	
Update the settings and file parameters corresponding to paths on your VM.

	nano settings.txt
	
Then verify that all is ok

	python3 settings_test.py
  
You can now use QGIS in the base installation and enable the conda environment to access OTB functionality. 
You can also move across environments to access libraries from either environment with python scripts as outlined below (see vector_classify_top.sh): <br>

  	echo "Starting OTB-QGIS pipeline...\n\n" 
  	conda run -n OTB python3 /home/code/otb_code_A.py 
  	python3 /home/code/qgis_code_A.py 
  	conda run -n OTB python3 /home/code/otb_code_B.py 
  	python3 /home/code/qgis_code_B.py 
	 
<i>Details on how to collect data from the European Space Agency's Sentinel program, how to make use of tip and cue, and how to perform various band-math operations and image classification with SVM, RF and NN classifiers is described in the Install+Use document.</i>

The collection directory contains some sample Sentinel2 data. Here are links to three high resolution 8-band (2022) and 4-band PlanetLab images (geoTIFF format, 500MB / 300MB each):
